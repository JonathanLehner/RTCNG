# Computer Graphics â€“ Bonus assignment

## Scene description - fish in a room
The scene is a fish bowl with a colourful fish in a room,
with light shining through a window and box next to it.

### Work
Used the code from Assignment 3: Ray tracing.
Added a background image.
Added volumetric refraction.
Created meshes.

But since the meshes too slowly, I had to redo my plan.
I decided to modify 
    - a background image
    - volumetric refraction with simple shapes
    - triangle inside a sphere
    - refraction

Run with: 
./raytracing && qlmanage -p rgb.ppm
And convert to png from there https://convertio.co/ppm-png/
